Lab06 feedback for Gabriel Gomez (gag014)
------------------------------------------------------------
Leaf Procedure: Leaf procedure implemented in prelab.s. Function returns the proper value. The
static variable C is properly defined in the data segment. $ra is noted for
the two calls to my_func in a comment.
	Score: 13 / 15
	Comment: Missing two $ra's in the comment

Collatz in C: collatz.c is completed correctly using a recursive function (find_length) and
a leaf function (collatz). C Coding conventions are followed (including adding
good comments and compilation instructions or a makefile).

xfind: (3 points) for documenting register assignments; (2 points) for commenting
code; (15 points) for correct functionality.

	Comment: -5: functionality: should have return the address of 'x', not its hex value.

largeproc: (5 points) for documenting register assignments; (5 points) for commenting
code; (5 points) for correct stack frame for small_proc; (5 points) for
correct stack frame for large_proc; (10 points) for correct functionality.

	Comment: The idea is that large_proc takes the six arguments at once. The two extra arguments (they don't fit in the four $a registers) should have been passed on the stack.

collatz: (3 points) for documenting register assignments; (2 points) for commenting
code; (10 points) for correct stack frames in all procedures; (10 points) for
correct functionality.

	Comment: Did not build stack frames for any procedures. Your code does not follow the MIPS convention and it will break when called by other assembled code.
